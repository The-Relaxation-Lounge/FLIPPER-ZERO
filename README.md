# FLIPPER ZERO
LED FLIPPER ZERO SWITCH European Style

This is actually my very first, on my own concept of making this
simple LED FLIPPER ZERO SWITCH. But in doing so, I had also
discovered how the black/ground wire acted like the positive
anode wire and the anode wire acted like the negative/ground
wire instead. Sounds contradictory to us, but it still works all the
same. lol
