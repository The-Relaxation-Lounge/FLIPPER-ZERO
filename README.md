# FLIPPER ZERO
LED FLIPPER ZERO SWITCH European Style

This is actually my very first, on my own concept of making this
simple LED FLIPPER ZERO SWITCH. But in doing so, I had also
discovered how the black/ground wire acted like the positive
anode wire and the anode wire acted like the negative/ground
wire instead. Sounds contradictory to us, but it still works all the
same. lol

How to use the 5V and Ground GPIO Pinouts

You can learn how to use the Flipper Zero's 5V GPIO pinout, along
with two RGB LEDS, which will use PULL UP and PULL DOWN resistors
that are built-in resistors on the other six GPIO pinouts. I sure hope
I've helped others out, while learning all about this Flipper Zero
Hacker Gadget.
